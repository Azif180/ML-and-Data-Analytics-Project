# ML-and-Data-Analytics-Project

Helo, My name is Azif â€” I am a motivated IT graduate who is passionate about Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI. 
This repository showcases my Final Year Project on predicting number of scam cases using machine learning, as well as 
3 mini project that I built to practice and sharpened my skills in Python and ML development on Jupyter Notebook. 
Each project is designed to demonstrate skills such as data understanding, manipulation, transformation
feature engineering, visualization, classification & predictive modeling, model fine-tuning and real-world problem solving.
